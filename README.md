# New Colossus ðŸ—½ Frontend

This is the frontend project for [New Colossus](https://github.com/for-idaho/new-colossus). It's really just a fancy web form.

## Tech 

New Colossus is built in [Nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), a boilerplate-lite React framework.


## Setup

After cloning the project, you can `cd` into it, and type `yarn` or `npm install` to get the dependencies.

Then, launch a new development version with:

```
yarn dev
```

or

``` 
npm run dev
```

You should then be able to open `localhost:3000` in your browser and see the project.
